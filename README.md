# react-ts-interview-tqahqg

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-interview-tqahqg)

## TODOs
Given more time, there's a plenty more things I would look to do:

- Implement a drop down to customise the number of results shown per page (thus utilising the `maxResults` argument in bookService)
- Write tests for the components
- Add CSS modules to the project to avoid class name clashes
- Review the accessibility of the project, ensure it is usable with a screenreader and navigatable using a keyboard
- Review if we indeed want to be limiting searches to `>2 chars` as  I have done or if API limits are not strict
- Improve mobile scalability (it's already usable but design needs improvement; e.g. font sizes can be smaller)
- Improve how long titles are handeled.
